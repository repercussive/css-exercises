You are currently reading a file called `README.md`. All files in this repository ending with `.md` are Markdown files. They all contain useful information and guidance about the exercises.

## How to approach the exercises

Each exercise is contained within a separate folder. 

Each exercise folder contains a file called `README.md`, which you should read through before starting each task. This is where you'll find out what the final product should look like.

You can then edit the `index.html` and `your-styles.css` files to complete each task.
